## Typing with COMET: (COntext-based Modeling for Expeditious Typing)

COMET is a platform provided by the Luxemburg Institute of Health, for HIV-1 and HIV-2 typing.
It is currently only available in their web platform, which can be practical for some but impractical for others.

**typing_with_comet.py** is a python script created to be ran in the terminal (commandline).
